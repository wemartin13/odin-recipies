    <p>This marinated flank steak turns out incredibly tender if cooked sous vide. I like to grill it afterwards for a couple of minutes for extra flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (such as Bragg)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) flank steak (about 1" thick</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off any surface fat from the steak.</li>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, honey, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic in a flat glass dish. Add steak and marinate in the refrigerator for 5 hours, turning occasionally.</li>
        <li>Place a heat-resistant pad underneath a large pot filled with water. Attach a sous vide precision cooker to the pot and set temperature to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Set timer for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the marinade and shake off excess liquid. Place into a bag and vacuum seal or use the water emersion method to remove all air.</li>
        <li>When timer is up, remove steak from the pot and pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Place steak on the hot grill and grill on one side for 2 to 3 minutes. Cut in half and serve.</li>
    </ol>
